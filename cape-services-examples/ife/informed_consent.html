<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>You have been invited to take part in the European project &ldquo;SIMPATICO - SIMplifying the interaction with Public Administration Through Information technology for Citizens and cOmpanies&rdquo; (hereinafter also referred to as &ldquo;SIMPATICO&rdquo;), coordinated by Fondazione Bruno Kessler - FBK (Italy). Before making a decision on whether you want to participate or not, please read this document carefully. Please ask all the questions you may have so you can be completely sure that you understand all the proceedings of the research, including risks and benefits. This informed consent document may include words that you do not understand. If this is the case, please ask the contact researcher or any other member of the study to fully explain the meaning of the word or clarify pieces of information. At all times, we assure the compliance with the current European and national legislation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Summary of the project</strong></p>

<p>A seamless interaction with public administrations (PA) is crucial to make the daily activities of companies and citizens more effective and efficient, saving time and money in the management of administrative processes. In particular, online public services have an enormous potential for reducing the administrative burden of companies and citizens, as well as for creating saving opportunities for the PA. This potential is however far from being fully exploited. Online services made available by the PA typically rely on standardized processes, copied from their offline counterparts and designed only from the public sector organizations&rsquo; own perspective. This results in online services that fail to adapt to the specific needs of citizens and companies.</p>

<p>With SIMPATICO, we address the issues above by proposing a novel approach for the delivery of personalized online services that, combining emerging technologies for language processing and machine learning with the wisdom of the crowd, makes interactions with the PA easier, more efficient and more effective. SIMPATICO combines top-down knowledge of the PA with bottom-up contributions coming from the community. These contributions can be of different types, ranging from the qualified expertise of civil servants and professionals to problems and doubts raised by citizens and companies that find online services difficult to use. Our approach is able to take into account both explicit information sources coming from citizens, professionals and civil servants, and implicit ones, extracted from user logs and past user interactions. SIMPATICO&rsquo;s &lsquo;learning by doing&rsquo; approach will use this information and match it with user profiles to continuously adapt and improve interactions with the public services. All the collected information on public services and procedures will be made available within Citizenpedia, a collective knowledge database released as a new public domain resource.</p>

<p>The piloting of the SIMPATICO solution in two European cities (Trento and Sheffield) and one region (Galicia) through a two-phase use-case validation will enable SIMPATICO to address the important objectives in the European Union eGovernment Action Plan 2011-2015. The stakeholders engaged in the three use-cases were selected for their experience and interest in e-services, as well as for the different socio-cultural backgrounds of the three regions. In this way, the Consortium have the opportunity to validate the effectiveness of the project results in contexts which differ on the number and heterogeneity of citizens and their social and cultural background. Project activities will last 3 years, from 1 March 2016 to 28 February 2019.</p>
